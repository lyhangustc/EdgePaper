\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we introduced self-attention mechanism to the conditional GANs and proposed conditional self-attention GANs (CSAGANs). This framework is able to capture the long-range dependencies across different regions of images and global structural information. With the help of the proposed conditional self-attention module, the proposed model is able to leverage the information of conditional images directly. With a series of experiments We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model and advantages compared to the pix2pix model.
