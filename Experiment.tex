\section{Experiment}
We propose Conditional Self-attention Generative Adversarial Networks (CSGANs), which translate images from one domain to another being able to capture long range dependencies and reserve the global structures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we have performed x sets of experiments. >>>>> A brief introduction of these experiments <<<<<

\subsection{ Evaluation Metrics}
The evaluation of generative images is a complicated task, because the model with good performance with respect to one criterion need not imply good performance with respect to the other criteria \cite{evaluation, GANs_equal}. Since the goal of image-to-image translation is to generate from the conditional image an corresponding image visually plausible to human, we mainly evaluate the results of different models by user studies. In addition, we use two popular criteria, Inception Scroee (IS) and Frèchet Inception Distance (FID) to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.
